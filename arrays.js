//  Answer: The const keyword doesn't allow reassignment, which means that you cannot reassign the array with some other data(assign a string to it for example). 
// That doesn't mean that you can't mutate the elements of the array. You can remove, add new elements and change 
// existing elements in the array. The array's contents remain mutable.
//My understanding is that const in this example means the variable can't be reassigned not that you can't manipulate it.So using Const is not wrong.
